Load all the lua scripts into Reaper's Action List.

Run SetUp script

To set up the correct monitor for displaying fx windows :
Click Set Up button

Enter the monitors X and Y coordinates - EG:  If you have 2 monitors - each 1920x1080 and you wanted to put the plugins on the
right monitor - the value of the X coordinate should be > 1920 and < 3840, and the Y coordinate should be > 0 and < 1080.  
If you wish the plugin window's to be able to fill the entire width of the screen (for monitor 2) - you would set 
x = 1920 (and width to 1920).

Hope that makes sense.

The Width and Height values should be the width/height of the screen (in pixels) or somewhere within that value if you wish to
only use part of the screen.

Once this is set up - you can test the settings using the SHOW/<</>> buttons.  The script acts on the currently selected track
only at the moment. 

SHOW: Opens the first plugins in the chain (as many as will fit on the designated area of the monitor).

>>:  Advances the page of plugins.
<<:  Goes back a page.

HIDE:  Closes all FX windows.

The Other Scripts - 
-------------------

Open - acts just like the Open button in the setup script.
NextPage - acts just like the >> button in the setup script.
PrevPage - acts just like the << button in the setup script.

These scripts can be added as toolbar buttons to a Reaper toolbar :)

Possible Issues - 
-----------------

Some (very few) plugins reset themselves whenever the chunk is altered (Acon Digital VST2 plugins for example - VST3 seem ok).  This script is
incompatible with any plugins that act in this way.
