Load all the lua scripts into Reaper's Action List.

Run SetUp script

To set up the correct monitor for displaying fx windows :
Click Set Up button

Enter the monitors X and Y coordinates - EG:  If you have 2 monitors - each 1920x1080 and you wanted to put the plugins on the
right monitor - the value of the X coordinate should be > 1920 and < 3840, and the Y coordinate should be > 0 and < 1080.  
If you wish the plugin window's to be able to fill the entire width of the screen (for monitor 2) - you would set 
x = 1920 (and width to 1920).

Hope that makes sense.

The Width and Height values should be the width/height of the screen (in pixels) or somewhere within that value if you wish to
only use part of the screen.

Once this is set up - you can test the settings using the SHOW/<</>> buttons 

SHOW: Opens the first plugins in the chain (as many as will fit on the designated area of the monitor).

>>:  Advances the page of plugins.
<<:  Goes back a page.

HIDE:  Closes all FX windows.



Possible Issues - 
-----------------

Some plugins are slow to show up - using the chunk to change the position of the windows (the only way
possible as far as I know) is not lightning quick.  Many plugins work fine like this - others such as Nebula may be slow or 
very slow to show up.  This is mainly due to the plugins being re-initialized by Reaper whenever the chunk is written.

Currently -  I don't know what will happen if you use many item FX.  Not tested - but have not added code to distinguish between
chunk data for the FX Chain and Item FX.  I will probably add in the future.

Some (very few) plugins reset themselves whenever the chunk is altered (Acon Digital plugins for example).  This script is
incompatible with any plugins that act in this way.
